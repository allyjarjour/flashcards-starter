# FlashCard Game

## Abstract
For this project, I was tasked to write a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line. The user is able to see the questions, take guesses, see a final score and also see their total time at the end of the round.

The main project goals were to use TDD to drive the code and also demonstrate single responsibility by breaking up the project into small classes.
